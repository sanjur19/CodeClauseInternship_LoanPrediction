# CodeClauseInternship_LoanPrediction
🔍 Just wrapped up an amazing internship at CodeClause, where I delved into Data Science by working on a loan prediction project using Python and Google Colab. 
Grateful for the guidance and learning opportunities. Excited for what's next! 🚀 #DataScience #Internship #CodeClause
